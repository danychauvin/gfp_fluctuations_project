# Reporter strains construction

The file `reporter_strains_construction.geneious` contains sequencing raw data of the locus HKO22 of the chromosome of the final reporter strains in the ab1 format, as well as alignment files that were used to assess that integration was correct. They were obtained the following way:

Glycerol stocks were streaked, and single colony picked the following day, to perform colony PCR using P1-HKO22 and P4-HKO22 (see supplementary methods for sequences). The size of the amplicon was checked on a gel, and then sent for Sanger sequencing together with primer S1 (reversed and aneal within the GFPmut2 sequence, see sequence in supplementary methods).

Integration control was performed either by comparing the sequencing raw data together with the relevant region of the pua66 vector (see hi1, hi3, med2 and med3 sequencing result alignment files), or by comparing sequencing raw data together with (1) the region that should be on the immediate 3 prime end of where the promoter was cloned (i.e from the BamHI site on) and (2)  expected promoter sequence obtained using MG1655 u00096.3 chromosome sequence and relevant primer sequences used in the Zaslaver library (Zaslaver et al (2006)), (see rplN and rrnB sequencing result alignment files).
